## My Portfolio Website. Kinda.
This started off as me wanting to finish a project, so I created a site for my web presence, that has links to various accounts. My goal is to get better at iterating my development/design projects and not worry about having things look perfect all the time. As they say, "Just do it." Execution means a lot more than ideas.

## Comments Welcome
If you see anything that seems odd or run into a glitch, just let me know or submit an issue on Github.
