# Social Media

## Current Situation
Our social media had been active when we were a part of colliers but when we decided to go back to our roots we had to convert all of our accounts and some of them were left behind and retired.

- No social media was driving traffic to our website
- We had no plan for what to post or when to post
- The only account that was active was the twitter and Linkedin account
- Our exsiting accounts were expremely incohesive and had different logos and different mission statements and information
- None of our accounts were verified

### Strengths
we were a young company and we were doing alot of cool things that provided a good opportunty to leverage social media. We are locally own-ed and Indianapolis had a tendidancy towards locally minded support of local businesses.

### Weaknesses
We did not have a ton of support, there were some brokers and leadership members who really were confident in our abillities and supported the idea of leveraging social media

### Opportunites
Not many CRE Firms were doing social media and if they were they weren't doing a very good job.

### Threats

## Process

I will admit we started pretty simple. We had alot on our plate and social media was one of those thigns that if we needed to coast somewhere it was going to be social media. Every month I would think about how we really needed to sit down and strategize how we wanted to do thigns nad how we wanted to spend our time.

### Youtube
I don't like adds or youtube so  decided to move all our videos to our Vimeo Pro Account.

We make changes to drone videos and I don;t like the idea of not being able to replace a video.

### Vimeo 
We bought vimeo Pro and use vimeo for drone videos and other videos that we may have.

## Biggest Challenges

## Useful tools along the way

- *Yext* tracks what listings have inconsistent information, we just used the free version
- *Google Analytics* shows how social media is sending traffic to your site
- *Buffer* helps you schedule social media posts across basically every network
- *Warble* Alerts sends you specified notifications so you can track hastags and keywords on twitter
- *Evernote* was where I documented progress and notes about each social media network, becuase it's easy to forget things
- *Bitly* tracked clicks on links from email signatures, printed materials and general links we shared, all in one place
