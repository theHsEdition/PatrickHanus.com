# Video production

## The Situation
We began with no video department at all. No equipment, no workflow, nothing. Sam Smith, the CEO of the company had high hopes for video production and wanted promo videos, drone videos and video to be a core part of RESOURCE unique offerings.

## The Process
Just as Rome wasn’t build in a day, I had to figure out how to tackle this project so that we could do videos in-house without a huge cost. 

    1. I scoped out equipment costs versus the cost of hiring a production studio and I was excited to start create awesome things. I was able to find a DSLR I liked that would double as a camera for shooting photos at events and for properties.
    
    2. We purchased the equipment and began using it casually on an as needed basis. There where other projects that took priority so we didn’t have time to plunge all-in into the promo video. Over the next 6 months we shot company events, we went along with some brokers to different clients to get general footage of "RESOURCE doing stuff.”
    
    3. As footage came in I slowly began developing a system to catalogue and organize footage. It was important that we kept track of the footage we had and that it was catalogued correctly so we could find clips we needed on a moments notice. We used lightroom for any photos, adding tags accordingly and we used adobe premiere for logging of footage. This step was especially important as when we needed to pull things together for the promo video, we could find them quickly and easily.
    
    4. I began to realize we needed to diversify the shots, DLSRs get pretty shaky so I had them purchase a budget SteadiCam to help us shoot moving shots of people walking, giving tours throughout a space and the like.
   
    5. We began scheduling interviews with the principals, asking them questions for about an hour, gathering as much information as possible. We did our best to ask a variety that would allow us to get as much use out of the interview, so we wouldn’t have to bug them any time soon.
    
    6. Standard Animations were needed for our materials, so they were created in Adobe After Effects by myself and
    
    7. I began researching drone costs, licensing and insurance details and came to the conclusion that it would be easier if  we maintained relationships with contractors to shoot footage for us, rather than shooting it ourselves.

## The Results
We created some great videos, each one got better. I worked closely with our lead designer to create graphics that we could animate in After Effects and use for social media posts, as standard video stingers, and for custom lower thirds in different videos.

### A Quick Look at what we do
This was a quick animated video that was designed to run on a local television network to help increase brand awareness and to explain in simple terms what RESOURCE does and how we help companies solve problems.

### Holiday Video
A video designed mainly as a holiday greeting blast that would go out to clients and outside brokers that work with RESOURCE. We showed some insight to the inside office of RESOURCE and took advantage of the holiday wrapping event that we do every year.

### RESOURCE Drone Videos
We now have an arsenal of drone videos that highlight properties throughout Indiana. Original graphics and Editing was done by me and the footage was shot by one of our various contractors.

### RESOURCE About us Promo
This was one of the dream projects I was hired for, it took about a year in the making but it was the core piece on out website to give clients, competitors, and potential recruits an inside look at RESOURCE

## In Review
I lead the team to create a successful video production department that would be organized and standardized enough to last beyond my employment at RESOURCE. The videos were a great success, the Principals and leadership at RESOURCE were happy and we were able to leverage social media advertising with our video.
