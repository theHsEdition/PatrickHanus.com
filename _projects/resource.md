## About RESOURCE

RESOURCE Commercial Real Estate is a boutique real estate firm that provides comprehensive solutions for every real estate need. RESOURCE had just recently broken away from the Colliers International flagship and rebranded themselves in the process. I was brought on to articulate this new brand and vision through video production, website management, email marketing and social media. There had previously been no position of this kind and there was not much to start with as the identity of the company was still growing and people were unsure how they would do on their own.

## The Current Situation
What we have on our hands now

When I first came as Digital Marketing Coordinator, RESOURCE had just finished creating a new website for the company with a local design company. The had spent a significant investment on the site, but unfortunately numerous people were very unhappy with it’s appearance, functionality and overall tone. Not only was the site unattractive and difficult to navigate, it was missing a lot of features that were important to to the leadership and brokers.

- Hits per day (~60/day)
- Leads per month (2 requests/month)
- Lead sources (No social refereals)
- SEO, didn’t show up until the third page on Google

## The Desired Situation
What I wanted, what the company wanted

## Proposed Strategy
What I thought was a good idea

Am I going to use a Wordpress theme or build my own?

- Plugins allow you to control what post categories are and the properties you use for each one.
- Some themes include the plugins, while others don’t. A paid theme is very different than a free theme. You have a tone more options
- I almost think it’s more worth it to start with a theme and then build our own theme down the road, because that keeps us focused on the content, pictures, and video, and the design/layout of the website doesn’t become crazy overwhelming. Not to mention, by using a baller theme, we maximize time and efforts for visual appeal. It would take me forever to do all the theme work myself to the same degree that these other themes have.

1. *Research.* I had to find a solution. The site was built on Wordpress, which at the time I had no idea what it’s capabilities were or how to use it effectively. I called people I knew did websites, I chatted with the cool cats over at Digital Telepathy and did my best to find out what our options where. I quickly realized that for what the leadership wanted, we had a very tall order and no one was willing to blow a ton of money to fix a website they had just purchased.

2. *Just Do it.* I figured we could create the website internally in a multi-phase process, that would allow us to slowly move forward the crucial parts (Figuring out who we were as a company and decrypting that for the lay person.) There was a lot to do, but if we split up the work, we could do it. I threw together a proposal for the executive committee. What we wanted to stress was that we were going to remain content-focused before all else, that way if we needed to hand the web aspects of the project off to someone else, we could and it wouldn’t be wasted time.

3. *More Research.* I now had to find out what this company actually did, how they did it and why they did it. I sat down with as many brokers as I could as well as the leadership to figure out what made this company great and why people should pick us over some other bigger firm. This was a really cool part of the project because I got to learn how commercial real estate works and why these people got in to the biz. I was able to get some questions together that worked pretty well, and they evolved as I went. on thing that was very interesting was how different people answered questions in completely different ways. That meant I had to do a lot of rephrasing on the fly and make sure I could help them get out what I was looking for.

I made a list of competitor's websites and tried to really analyze what they were doing well and what they were lacking in.

- bradleyco.com
- CBRE.com
- ksmcpa.com
- colliers.com

4. Emergency Phase 1. I realized we needed a rushed redesign of the home page that would help us retain some viewers. The current page had a block of text that got a whopping zero on the Fleshing Reading Score and a faded picture of what looked like some windows. That was it. The redesign would include more pictures, icons, explanations of our services, links to social media and a contact form that would lead directly into salesforce via integration.

- We moved the site over to godaddy from being hosted by our IT company. Some users in the office were having trouble accesing the new site becuase they were ending up on cached versions of the site or some of them were on the old version of the site at the old location.

- We moved our site over to SSL for google SEO purposes and that was pretty easy but we had to fix some links here and there. Godaddy makes it surprisingly easy to convert. I had to hop in and make sure any embennd links or linked script were being called over SSL as well.

## How We (Actually) Did it
The process we followed to reach our goals

### Step 1 - Content Focused

	5. Page write-ups were tedious. These bad boys contained the entire outline of each page, what should be on it in terms of buttons, outbound links, copywriting, suggestions for pictures, etc. These were the lifeblood of the website. They contained everything and as we stressed early, would dictate the content of the site, which then determines the layout and experience we create for the user.

	Meet with Sam:
	- Get Sayings approved
	- Main Saying
	- Industry Sayings
	- Services and Industries Approved

	6. Case Studies. Case studies were going to be a huge aspect of the new site. they were the bread and butter of proving RESOURCE had what it took to do great work and it was also very important to the leadership. Case studies may have been the most difficult thing because so much of it required getting brokers to sit down and write up a story about how they won a deal. There was a lot of back and forth, bugging people and babysitting that had to happen but eventually we got them all together and were able to get one for every specialty as well as each service line.

	7. New profile pictures and biographies for everyone. The only ones were literally in black and white and had been heavily photoshopped. People looked almost unrecognizable and from very early on people were continuously bugging me for are profile pictures. With the help of the lovely Carrie Smith, we scheduled all 48 employees and shot pictures for all of them. We all now had beautiful color pictures for everyone.

### Step 2 - Design with users in mind

	8. The forboding site structure. This part was very tricky. I made a post-it for each page and another one for each and went to town trying g to figure out the differences between services and industries, what information is most important and how we want users to navigate through the site. I definitely got a little stressed here. It was also here where I wanted to figure out what topics deserve a section, what should be a post and what should be a page.



	9. Photoshop mockups where by far the most fun part. It was neat to see things evolve as time went on. This evolving also became super annoying because I had to find ways to make sure I wasn’t becoming inconsistent in my layouts our in things like my buttons. Using photoshop art-boards was super handy and I eventually came across a system that worked pretty well for me.

	10. Website Style guide which standardizes all the styles so that you transition to code with ease. It was during this time where I realize using Sketch would have been cool and I want to use that instead of Photoshop

	is finding out how to use a proper grid system. It’s the foundation of the site layout and I feel a little lost. 
	-I think what I might do a 12-column grid for desktop, 8 for tablet and 4 for mobile.
	-I found a template called “un-semantic” which seems pretty cool.
	
	11. SEO and PageSpeed Optimization. I found some pretty cool tools along the way and I will say one of my favorite things is making pages load faster. Trimming the fat. [Put some cool stats and before and after graphs here]

### Step 3 - Development

	To be completely honest I had barely a working knowledge of HTML when I started so all I knew was that the existed site was slow, violated every principal of design that I held dear, and the writing was worse than my 2nd grade journal entries. I was kind of scared and overwhelmed. I didn’t know where to begin. I came on thinking I was going to be making cool videos and interviewing local townsfolk. This was by far the biggest and most daunting project of them all. It was the HQ where everything else relies on. Everything digital should be pointing to the website and I had to make sure that it was a site worth pointing back to. Once I got my bearings, I broke the process down into some tangible steps.

	Bones looks like a cool starter theme, and it starts you out a little more than underscores. It supports sass.

	It assumes more than underscores.

	I am having a really hard time finding a theme that looks like the way I want. I don’t want to get backed into something I’m not happy with…This is hard.

	When I realized that X theme wasn't very friendly when it came to creating custome post types where i could have peole who don't know website stuff, I moved away from X theme and decided to try something different.

### Launch
We are live...I hope.

## The Clean up
The Site was launched, now to clean up the mess

The month after was interesting. I realized I had to figure out a way of capturing complaints as well as prioritizing problems as we got them. I had a couple members of the staff who where very helpful  in combing the website, looking for errors and fixing the small things. 

I wanted to use GitHub to track issues and milestones, but didn’t want my colleagues to have to make a login for just this, especially because most of them are common folk and are not very tech savvy. For a while we used slack where each of them would submit problems as a message in a specific channel and then I would  sift through the problems and add a green check mark emojie the things where completed, or an X if it was something that I wasn’t going to fix. this worked well but it was annoying and hard to organize and I didn’t want to copy the problems by hand. 

I ended up find a cool integration using Zapier that automatically made a Github issue when a message was entered into the #webdev Slack channel. This has so far worked really well and saved a lot of time and headache.

### My New Problems
- Adding Schema.org support in JSON and micro data (Real Estate is very lacking in this area)
- Optimizing for search and trying to leverage Google’s rich snippets and Cards
- Add a site-wide search feature throughout the site for Case Studies, Brokers, and Listings
- I have had a lot of trouble with the Search form at the bottom of the page and trying to get the ReCaptcha to work with that.
- I have had a specifically needy team that required a listing feature immediately and has been very needy and annoying to work with. Each day they had new problems and would bring the 
- It’s really annoying to not have the latest updated data in my local install of rcre.com and I have no energy to install the latest data from the live site. This makes development tricky.

- Get the blog going on a regular basis

### Problem Spotlight

I was having a huge problem getting Listings showing in a section ordered by date which was necessary for one of our teams at the office.

- the time value from wpcf was stored in a timestamp format which made things much more difficult

1. Query listings looking for “closed”
2. if date is same year as the year stored in variable show listing
3. if not and date is different year display the year heading and then begin showing listings

## Review 

### Biggest Challenges
The obstables throughout the process,

### Biggest Lessions

- How to build real websites (I can’t believe how far I’ve come
- Make an awesome user experience first, then sell stuff
- Agile work mentality, iterate and scale as you go
- Make decisions and ask for forgiveness (Approvals from people waste their time)
- You can't wait for people to do things. You just have to start doing things and them people will jump in

The reason you have dry code is because it ensures you don’t go chasing your tail for two hours only to realize you were editing the wrong bit of code over 50 times. I ran into that problem with the case studies…I really learned to not repeat myself and shave down my code so it made more sense and wasn’t being repetitive.

## Cool Sites and Apps that helped along the way

- gtmetrix.com
- tools.pingdom.com
- testmysite.withgoogle.com
- www.similarweb.com

### Software
- Sublime Text 2 (code editing for php, html, sass)
- Mamp Pro 3 (hosting old resource site, hosting dev site)
- Forklift/Transmit 4
- Codekit
- Google Chrome (I like the dev tools on this better, but I would also test in Safari, Opera and Firefox)
- Terminal
- GitHub/Git
- Adobe Photoshop
- InvisionApp
- Filezilla ( When I needed to FTP stuff, before i discovered scp—10000x faster)

# Video production

## The Situation
We began with no video department at all. No equipment, no workflow, nothing. Sam Smith, the CEO of the company had high hopes for video production and wanted promo videos, drone videos and video to be a core part of RESOURCE unique offerings.

## The Process
Just as Rome wasn’t build in a day, I had to figure out how to tackle this project so that we could do videos in-house without a huge cost. 

    1. I scoped out equipment costs versus the cost of hiring a production studio and I was excited to start create awesome things. I was able to find a DSLR I liked that would double as a camera for shooting photos at events and for properties.
    
    2. We purchased the equipment and began using it casually on an as needed basis. There where other projects that took priority so we didn’t have time to plunge all-in into the promo video. Over the next 6 months we shot company events, we went along with some brokers to different clients to get general footage of "RESOURCE doing stuff.”
    
    3. As footage came in I slowly began developing a system to catalogue and organize footage. It was important that we kept track of the footage we had and that it was catalogued correctly so we could find clips we needed on a moments notice. We used lightroom for any photos, adding tags accordingly and we used adobe premiere for logging of footage. This step was especially important as when we needed to pull things together for the promo video, we could find them quickly and easily.
    
    4. I began to realize we needed to diversify the shots, DLSRs get pretty shaky so I had them purchase a budget SteadiCam to help us shoot moving shots of people walking, giving tours throughout a space and the like.
   
    5. We began scheduling interviews with the principals, asking them questions for about an hour, gathering as much information as possible. We did our best to ask a variety that would allow us to get as much use out of the interview, so we wouldn’t have to bug them any time soon.
    
    6. Standard Animations were needed for our materials, so they were created in Adobe After Effects by myself and
    
    7. I began researching drone costs, licensing and insurance details and came to the conclusion that it would be easier if  we maintained relationships with contractors to shoot footage for us, rather than shooting it ourselves.

## The Results
We created some great videos, each one got better. I worked closely with our lead designer to create graphics that we could animate in After Effects and use for social media posts, as standard video stingers, and for custom lower thirds in different videos.

### A Quick Look at what we do
This was a quick animated video that was designed to run on a local television network to help increase brand awareness and to explain in simple terms what RESOURCE does and how we help companies solve problems.

### Holiday Video
A video designed mainly as a holiday greeting blast that would go out to clients and outside brokers that work with RESOURCE. We showed some insight to the inside office of RESOURCE and took advantage of the holiday wrapping event that we do every year.

	-> Watch Here

### RESOURCE Drone Videos
We now have an arsenal of drone videos that highlight properties throughout Indiana. Original graphics and Editing was done by me and the footage was shot by one of our various contractors.

	-> Watch Here

### RESOURCE About us Promo
This was one of the dream projects I was hired for, it took about a year in the making but it was the core piece on out website to give clients, competitors, and potential recruits an inside look at RESOURCE

## In Review
I lead the team to create a successful video production department that would be organized and standardized enough to last beyond my employment at RESOURCE. The videos were a great success, the Principals and leadership at RESOURCE were happy and we were able to leverage social media advertising with our video.

### Biggest learning moments:
Slow and steady wins the race
Delegate as much as you can
Organization makes a huge difference

### Software used:
Adobe After Effects
Adobe Premiere
Adobe Media Encoder
Mocha for After Effects

# Social Media

## Current Situation
Our social media had been active when we were a part of colliers but when we decided to go back to our roots we had to convert all of our accounts and some of them were left behind and retired.

- No social media was driving traffic to our website
- We had no plan for what to post or when to post
- The only account that was active was the twitter and Linkedin account
- Our exsiting accounts were expremely incohesive and had different logos and different mission statements and information
- None of our accounts were verified

### Strengths
we were a young company and we were doing alot of cool things that provided a good opportunty to leverage social media. We are locally own-ed and Indianapolis had a tendidancy towards locally minded support of local businesses.

### Weaknesses
We did not have a ton of support, there were some brokers and leadership members who really were confident in our abillities and supported the idea of leveraging social media

### Opportunites
Not many CRE Firms were doing social media and if they were they weren't doing a very good job

### Threats

## Process

### Youtube
I don't like adds or youtube so  decided to move all our videos to our Vimeo Pro Account.

We make changes to drone videos and I don;t like the idea of not being able to replace a video.

### Vimeo 
We bought vimeo Pro and use vimeo for drone videos and other videos that we may have.
