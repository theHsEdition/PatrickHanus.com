## About Man the Movie

A Mediocre Short Film. This was for sure my first project where I realized how much I love working with people and being part of projects that are over a long period of time. The goal was to make an amazing student production that didn't look like a student production. We wanted to create something we could be proud of for our reels and portfolios. We had a budget of about 30 bucks and equipment from friends as well as our Communication Arts department.

Coming up with the story was tricky; being original is much harder than we thought. We had numerous brainstorming sessions that didn't yield what we were looking for. After much yelling and confusion, the idea for Man was finally created and pre-production began. There was tons to do. A script had to be written, storyboards to be drawn, shooting schedules to be arranged. Luckily with the help of Zachary Wehner, Taylor Graff and many others we forced our way though.

Production was definitely the most difficult part of our short film. Many of us had busy schedules, all of us taking 15-18 college credits, working at least 12 hours a week, as well as involvement in other extra-curricular activities. To try and get everyone, crew and cast, to locations was almost impossible. Many last minute and early morning shoots were quite tense. Luckily, it all worked out in the end, all of our shoots went mostly to plan.

## Post-Production

- Editing
- Special Effects
- Color Grading

- Audio Production

It's going to be extremely important to pay attention to the sounds we will need once we get into post production.

1. all the dialogue needs to be captured on location for reference in the studio.

2. Any ambient noises need to be noted and possibly recorded for reference as well.

3. Any sounds that will be difficult to emulate or reproduce need to be recorded on location in as high quality as possible.
