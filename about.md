<h2>Prologue</h2>

Hi, I’m a designer by trade and a storyteller at heart. Blah blah blah what the F does that even mean? I’m a superficial designer living a superficial life full of doubt, imposter-syndrome and self-loathing.

<h2>Background</h2>

I lived in New Mexico for 9 years where I learned how to dress up like a cowboy, that running away from home was frowned upon and talking back to my mom would not be tolerated. I when our whole family got the flu every winter  I would throw up in the large spaghetti pot as my little feet pounded the floor on the sprint to the bathroom.

We were uprooted and moved to Maryland because God told my parents to do it. I learned to just with change. It was here I learned to trace sonic the hedgehog pictures on my classroom windows and I decided I wanted to draw stuff. It was also here where I learned HTML from my computer teacher and proceeded to try and re-create the Syndrome’s computer thing in the form of the website with some slight success.

I then moved to NY and finished up Middle school and high school where I learned Photoshop and Adobe Premiere, photoshopping my dad’s head on a baby’s body followed by the sequel of Justin Bieber’s head on a baby’s body. I thought that was really funny.

I then when to college in Steubenville, Ohio where I was introduced to the wonderful world of After Effects, Avid Media Composer and shooting videos on real camera equipment and not a Kodak point-and-shoot. I made some of my proudest work with two short films that still make me laugh but still confuse my mom. It was also here where I realized I loved working with people and getting things done with a team.

After graduating college I moved out to Indianapolis mainly to make my mom love me more, but also because I didn’t realize how lame Indiana was at the time. It’s in the middle of nowhere, if you weren’t aware. I did start a company with my college friend that built website for people and helped them look their best on the web.

<h2>The goal for the future</h2>

I enjoy traveling, and getting outside of my comfort-zone traveling Europe or around the United States. The real dream is to write and produce television shows and movies that are based around great stories that show people the truth and shine a light in a time that is so dark.
