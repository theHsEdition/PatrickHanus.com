Despite the availability of education in the 21st Century, the infamous "student loan" plagues students across the globe (probably). Millennials are shooting their own lives in the foot, as they attempt to begin their careers with overwhelming amounts of debt.

I love my parents and they are great people but when you are 1 of 5 children, they didn't have the means to put me through college. When I graduated college I had about $25k in student loans. I will be the first to admit this isn't really that bad, but that is also part of how I paid them off in 2 years.

Think of the following as a 4 year program that is part of college eduction. For those of you who are graduated, it's a 2 year program.

## I hate loans more than anything else in the world.

I hate owing people money. I like paying for things myself. I don't like losing money to interest. It's another reason I hate renting, but that's a different story for a different time. I decided when I was young to put together a plan to pay off my student loans. It wasn't so much as a plan as it was a _lifestyle_.

There are three stages to how I saved enough and made enough to pay off my loans.

* [Before college (About 4 years)](/#Before-College "Before College")
* [During college (3 and 1/2 years)](/#during-college "During College")
* [After college ( 2 years - the powerhouse years)](/#after-college "After College")

### Before College

If you're saving money for college, than here's your best bet.

* Right now is when you are building up your money
* Save money
* Work jobs
  I was working from the day of my 14th birthday. It was not fun counting tiny bolts in an industrial battery warehouse, but I needed the work.
* Apply to scholoarships
  This was an area I really fell short, and I could have saved a ton of money if I had taken advantage of it. I would encourage you to look into major-specific scholarships offered by your school, those tend to be forgotten.
* Do well in school
  When it comes Acedemic scholarships, depending on the school, SAT and ACT scores can have a HUGE impact on the money you can receive. I was lucky to get some pretty great scholarships.
* Take college courses
  During Highschool, I paid the $300 for college courses that were offered at school. The workload really wasn't to hard and as a result I was able to graduate a semester early—saving $17k!

### During College

For you young kiddos still in college, here are some tips to saving money while still having a good time. There were many times I didn't do things because it cost money, but there were even more times where I still had an awesome time and found a way to do things that didn't cost money.

* **Pay as you go**. Remember, you don't have to pay college all at once. Part of the reason I only had $25k in loans was becuase I managed to pay off the rest out of pocket as I went. there were some times I barely scraped by, but my main goal was to avoid getting any additional loans outside of my government loans.
* **Worked various jobs at school, from day one.** I found a job in the video lab that would let me work up to 20 hours a week on campus, no commuting necessary. Because campus had a limit on I also found a job that was shooting video
* **Save money.** This might seem obvious, but it's still worth saying. Work, birthdays, Christmas, no matter the income source, you can't view the money as _yours_. It's not yours. It belongs to Fannie Mae and they are letting you borrow it—for a fee!
* **Spend time with people, but don’t feel obligated to spend money.**
  There were many, many times I was the lame one who ordered the water and ate the free bread. I learned to accept it and take the labels with pride. I was saving money to pay for college and if that means being a cheapskate, I don't mind. I believe this is where you can save the most. People love eating out and they love dragging people out with them, I'd be happy to spend time with people, but I'm not spending $8 on a sanwich I can make for $2 at home.
* **Reel in the drinking habit.** Drinking is very expensive. It's really not worth it. From a purily objective point of view its a complete luxary and if it's a necessity to you than your problems may go deeper than student loans...
* **Don't get a car.** You'll save more money than you can imagine by not getting a car. I understand for some people this is not an option, but onece you get a car there are mechanical issues, rountine maintenance, insurance, gas and other things that inevitably show up with car ownership. It's a pain, but we are trading convience for money here.
* **Reapply to scholarships**. Oftentimes you'll end up with one-time scholarships that are only good for a year. Apply to scholarships every year to make sure you're
* **Negotiate with the admissions office.** If you are really close to being able to paying in full for a semester, you can reason with the admissions offic and they have the inside information on new scholarships, available funds.
* **Major in something that will actually make you money.** I know we've hear it before but a philosophy degree is not going to put food in your mouth or Netflix on the TV. Pick a major that is going to make you happy while getting you a job that justifies the investment of an education.

### After Graduation: Make More, Spend Less - A Modern Peasant's Lifestyle

I recently heard Pete the Planner speak and he talked about the dangers of what he refers to as "Lifestyle Creep." This is where you start to make more money and slowly scale your lifestyle to match. This is why people never get out of debt. This is why people feel like they are always drowning. To counter this, here's my approach. Every year the goal should be how to cut costs:

Get a good job.  
This might seem dumb, but it's often a mistake people make. Jobs can be hard to get, but they don't have to be. Spend some good time putting together a well-written resume, a cover letter that explains why you want to work at that particular company and really try to find a company where there is room to grow. It's amazing to me the number of people who just dump their resume into an indeed template and shoot it off to everyone in the world, regardless of how qualified they are.

Never eat out, never drink out.
This sounds depressing, but it's true. No matter how you shake it, eating out is a luxary and is one of the biggest ways people waste money. You have to remember that this is a temporary pain that will pass and once you pay off your loans you can eat, drink and be merry.

Apart from giving yourself a slight “reward allowance” You need to bake it into your head that eating out is ALWAYS a waste of money. It’s never worth it. The only time I let myself eat out is when It’s with a bunch of people and it’s about the time I’m going to spend with them. But even this is rare. It’s okay to go out with friends and just order a water. Unconventional, yes, but I have done it countless times and I have still enjoyed myself. Food and alcohol are expensive and it doesn’t make sense to go out to eat when you own someone $30k. Even with a low interest rate.

Work a second job.
From what I hear alot of peole are doing this, but it's important to not just get any job. You want to find a job that allows you to get the best return for your time. If I had gotten a different job, I could make way more moeny, buy I decided to start a company with a friend of mine, helping businesses with their websites and their marketing. We brought in about $7k in our first year, it might not seem like much but it was good money and that was money that I could put towards my loans. I also see this as an investment, to make way more money in the future.

Sweat the Small Stuff: Walk to work
It’s not about winning the lottery or finding 100 dollar bills on the street, it’s really a constant flow of small sacrifices that result in a big difference over a long period of time.

_Cheaper Rent_
I found cheaper rent for my second year in a crappier apartment, but it knocked $130 off my bill each month.

_Get rid of internet_
I canceled my internet when I moved, resulting in an extra $50/month.

_Don't pay into your 401(k)_
The goal is to pay off your interest, so if you're paying 10% interest, your money is worth more paying off the debt rather than making investments this early in your life.

_Go with a cheaper phone plan_
Chances are you can get away with WiFi only in this wonderful world we live in, saving you around $30/mo, maybe more

_Get rid of the excess_
This includes Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, anything extra. You don't need it and you can always go back.

_Eat like your life isn't depending on it_
I ate oatmeal for breakfast for 2 years. Now there was some variation here and there, I won't be totalluy dramatic, but for the most part it was oatmeal. Shopping at Aldi was the other half of the equation. I was able to save so much on groceries, it wasn't funny. And while eating healthy. I believe eating well is a critical element. Say goodbye to the processed foods and the premade goods. I buy a ton of fresh veggies, fruits, eggs and meat. Stick to the basics. I spend on average $35 in groceries, which lasts me about \~9 days or so, but that is pushing it a bit.

* Use the "price per ounce/lb" to gauge what product is most worth your money
* Don't buy packaged goods, buy it fresh
* Cut back on meat (it's expensive)
* Skip things that are't on sale (this means eating based on availablity)
* Keep laying off the alcohol (it's not worth it)

#### Bonus: Give 150% and Ask for a Raise

This isn't always available to everyone, but it is important. Especially if you are a hard worker, chances are you are probably being underpaid.

The only way this works is if you truly make yourself an asset at work that no one can find anywhere else. **This means working late, finding ways to save the company money and bringing real value to the table.** Exceed expectations in every way. You can't just ask for a raise because you feel like it—you need to make it obvious you deserve one. I once heard that 1 Million Dollars was left on the table in your lifetime for never asking for a raise. That is a lot of money.

Approach your employer with a pitch for why you want a raise and your reasons for your target range. Put together a roadmap to show how you have helped grow the company and save the business money. Take some time to research negotiation skills, there's a book I can't recommend more called "Never Split the Difference." Too many of us won't stick up for ourselves and so we spend most of our lives being taken advantage of.

## In review: Mindset Shift => I Deserve Nothing

You need to realize that when you are in debt you own nothing. The money you're making is someone else's money. Once we learn to think like this it's much easier to start living the meager lifestyle necessary to pay back loans like this at such a rapid rate.

The prevalent attitude of rewarding ourselves with money that doesn't belong to us is fundamentally flawed. We keep lying to ourselves. I think this is one of the critical issues in the minds of millennials. We need to grow up and be responsible for our own lives and our own educations.

Focus on People  
Going out the movies is a lousy way to spend time with someone. Try going for a walk. Go hiking at the state park.

**Don't Despair!**

**Focus on people**

There is nothing more freeing than paying off your last student loan. It has been almost a lifelong goal of mine now I can say that I paid my way through college and I'm debt free at 23.

I encourage you to throw a party when you pay your last loan. Let loose a little spend some money to enjoy yourself. You deserve it. Me, I bought a handle of bourbon, a flank steak and enjoyed both by a crackling fire...or maybe that was Ron Swanson.

You are trading convenience for money, so life is going to be a bit inconvenient until then, but it's worth it!

### Good luck out there :)
