## 10-second Profile
I was born in NY, but I've lived in 6 different states and counting. I spend my free time designing, developing and creating at my web design studio in Indianapolis. If I need to stop staring at the computer, I love playing indoor soccer, drawing charicatures, and drinking great coffee or a cold Guinness with friends.

- Figuring out cool Zapier automations to make life easier. 
- Running 2 miles every day. 
- Trying to journal more to keep track of life.
- Enjoying the rest of the Indiana summer
