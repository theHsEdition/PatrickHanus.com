## Prologue

Hi, I’m a designer by trade and a storyteller at heart. Blah blah blah what the heck does that even mean? Let's get real here. I’m a superficial designer living a superficial life full of doubt, imposter-syndrome and self-loathing. Even my kids hate me.

## Background Check

Although I was born in NY, I spent the first 9 years of my life in New Mexico where I learned how to dress up like a cowboy, why running away from home was frowned upon and talking back to my mom would not be tolerated. When our whole family got the flu every winter I would throw up in the large spaghetti pot as my little feet pounded the floor on the "sprint" to the bathroom.

We were then uprooted and moved to Maryland because God told my parents to do it. I learned to adjust with change. It was here I learned to trace Sonic the Hedgehog pictures (my frist experience of copyright infringement) on my classroom windows. From there I decided I wanted to draw stuff. It was also here where I learned HTML from my computer teacher as a fourth-grader and proceeded to try and re-create the Syndrome’s computer thing in the form of the website with some slight success.

We moved to Upstate NY and finished up Middle school and high school where I learned Photoshop and Adobe Premiere, photoshopping my dad’s head on a baby’s body followed by the sequel of Justin Bieber’s head on a baby’s body. I thought that was really funny.

I then when to college in Steubenville, Ohio where I was introduced to the wonderful world of After Effects, Avid Media Composer and shooting videos on real camera equipment and not a Kodak point-and-shoot. I made some of my proudest work with two short films that still make me laugh but still confuse my mom. It was also here where I realized I loved working with people and getting things done with a team. Up until this point I had an odd dislike for writing, but after writing my first script I realized I had stumbled upon true storytelling. I now have 6 different tv shows on the back-burner along with a couple movies. (My back-burner is pretty over-crowded.

After graduating college I moved out to Indianapolis, IN mainly to make my mom love me more, but also because I didn’t realize how lame Indiana was at the time. It’s in the middle of nowhere—if you weren’t aware. I eventually got bored and I started a company with my college friend that built website for people and helped them look and sound their best on the web.

## What I'm Up to Now

Things are pretty good. I'm living in Indianapolis building websites and figuring out life. Indianapolis is a cool town that's not too big and not too small, there are a lot of great businesses trying to help grow their city, which I can appreiciate.

I fill my free time with trying to learn new things that make website load faster, dibble-dabbling in app development, and spending time with my friends, just experiencing this great life we all have. I will admit I have the occasional Netflix outbreak, but I'm trying to build good habits, stay active and eat healthy. It's always going to be a battle.

## The Goal for the Future

I enjoy traveling, and getting outside of my comfort-zone traveling Europe or around the United States. The real dream is to write and produce television shows and movies. I think we need more entertainment that is based around great stories—showing people the truth and shine a light in a time that is so dark.	Entertainment shouldn't be about wasting time or money. It should be an experience that changes your life, hopefully for the better.

In order to achieve my calling I hope to build businesses along the way that help me make money for my life as well as proving a great place for people to work. My dream will take a lot of money and a lot of great people working together.

Cheers,

Patrick
