How a name-game-campaign changed the way I think about marketing.

## MailChimp Champ

I’ve been a fan of MailChimp for a while now. We switched over to them almost a year ago for our email marketing at a commercial real estate company and it’s been love ever since. They’ve been a fun bunch of people to work with and they have a great product. I thought I understood them and they understood me.

Then one morning something happened.

I discovered JailBlimp, KaleLimp, MailShrimp, SnailPrimp, VeilHymn, WaleSynth, MaleCrimp, FailChips, and NailChamp.

It is absolutely fascinating. The amount of detail, work and thought that was put into these projects is unbelievable. It’s hard to believe these worlds were created simply because the folks of MailChimp thought they were cool and gambled that some other people would feel the same way.


Initially, I felt absolutely stunned by the amount of work it must have taken. The color palettes, the images, the music, the individual social media accounts. It was a perfectly executed campaign that spoke — no yelled — right to me. It said:

> |FNAME|! Wake up! Get out there and make awesome things. Entertain people.

It did more than speak to me.

It then pushed me over the edge to the point where I asked myself: “What the heck am I doing? What have I created? How the heck do I live with myself? Did I pay the rent this week?”

It set the bar high for creative ad campaigns. In short, I felt more inadequate than if my credit card got declined while taking a girl on a date resulting in her paying for the ice cream. It was like MailChimp had taken all the good ideas and there was no way in heck I could ever come close to creating something of that magnitude or fantastic creativity. It was just everything I ever wanted.

How am I supposed to do stuff like that? I’m just a MaleChump.
As ridiculous as it may sound, I was really depressed that morning of discovery as I scrolled through one of the many new Instagram accounts that had been made for the various MailChimpian-derivatives. I felt simultaneously inspired and beat-down. I fell into a deep funk. I also didn’t really know why.

## A Kick in the Chimp.

It’s so easy to go through the motions of sharing crap on the inter-webs. I find myself slipping into a lot of not-creating and doing-the-same-things. It’s easy to mindlessly share a random article on twitter. Or use the same template for marketing emails. Or go to the same restaurant for first dates — only to find out maybe the reoccurring food-poisoning isn’t “just a coincidence.”

MailChimp reminded me that I love marketing stuff. I love using creativity and design to catch people’s attention. But how much of that love translates into actually creating things for people to enjoy?

I told my co-worker: Who’s to say we can’t do this? Who’s to say we can’t amaze and fascinate people with the projects we work on? Commercial real estate is about as boring as it gets, but what if we made it awesome?

I don’t have a master plan of what I want to do yet. I just have random ideas floating around in my head, like maybe creating a commercial real estate sit-com or perhaps renting a blimp and throwing our logo on it. I really don’t know yet.

For me, this campaign was exactly what I needed. It made me feel guilty — but it also inspired me. It’s easy to sit back and do the same old mumbo-jumbo that people expect. But now I feel like I owe it to MailChimp to do more of the unexpected, to branch out and take some risks. There are “some people” who probably think this name-game-campaign is ridiculous and confusing. They would be absolutely right. That is exactly why I love it and I say keep it up; I’m a huge fan, and MailChimp has my vote.

## TL;DR

I love MailChimp more than ever, simply because they are fun and outrageous (in a good way).
MailChimp set the bar even higher using a fantastic content-focused campaign to show their customers that they love them.
I needed a wake-up call, I got one, and I now feel inspired to create more imaginative content to entertain people and reach clients.
