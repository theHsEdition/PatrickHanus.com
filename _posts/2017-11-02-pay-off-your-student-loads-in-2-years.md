## I hate loans more than anything else in the world.
I hate owing people money. I like paying for things myself. I don't like losing money to interest. It's another reason I hate renting, but that's a different story for a different time. I out together a plan to pay off my student loans. It wasn't so much as a plan as it was a *lifestyle*.

### In the beginning.
So when I graduated school I had about $25k in student loans. I will be the first to admit this isn't really that bad, but that is also part of how I paid them off in 2 years.

### Before College

### During CollegeWorked at school


### After Graduation:
- live on borrowed time
- never eat out, never drink out
- work a second job
- always cut costs
- cheaper rent for year 2
- cut out internet for year 2
- ask for a raise
- I deserve nothing
- walk to work
