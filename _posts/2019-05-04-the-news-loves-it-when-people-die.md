## “The News” needs to Die.
I know this a provocative title. I promise this article isn’t political. I have a thought I think is important and my mom thinks so too.

Today I was at work making changes to the code on my company’s website, trying to ignore Slack and forgetting my coffee was still cold. We had the news on in our office area. (We like to pretend like we can multi-task and still get things done with the TV on in the background. Typical millennials.) A breaking news segment suddenly came on about the terror in Barcelona. Truly messed up stuff, I’m very saddened by the tragedy.

As the anchors inteviewed a caller eye-witness, they showed a clip of the panic and people rushing around, casully asking dumb questions and trying to draw conclusions blah blah blah. It was the usual until, amongst the crowds, the camera focused on a poor fellow human, whose leg was horribly twisted, clearly broken, struggling to get up. It was horrifying and graphic, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

## I’m not afraid of the facts.
I’ve seen bad things before. I’m not a “weak-stomached” person. What upsets me is how news outlets don’t care about these people. It happens every time something bad happens. With every new tragedy “The Media” kicks into action to make sure they can get the bloodiest, most horrifying shot—each one worse than the last—so they can win the prize of your viewership. Sure they act sad and upset but I can’t help feel their excitement whenever something bad happens. They love it. Especially the graphic shootings and terrorist attacks. Have some decency, shall we?

Why are they excited? Many of us forget the news is all about ratings. They make more money when you’re watching their show. They have advertisers that pay them to run a commercial about how greek yogurt can change someone’s life, strengthen their marriage, etc. The more people who watch news, the more money they make.

## Who does it help?
This is no different than the Romans watching people get devoured by lions in the colluseum. It’s just disguised in the name of “information.” Out of respect for the victims, there are some things that the world doesn’t need to see. Who does it help? Not the victims. The terrorists and murderers are the ones who are winning here. We spend the whole day talking about what they did and that is exactly what they set out to do. They wanted the attention and we’re giving it to them.

Bottom line, you need to stop watching the news.
It’s bringing you down. It’s showcasing humanities worst and their victims like it’s a sport. The Media reaps the benefits of increased viewership and THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. It’s all about the money.

I don’t care if you have a fear of missing out, I don’t care how people “want to be aware of things.” It doesn’t matter. You watching someone getting plowed over by a truck on TV is not helping anyone. Go out and be a good person. Stop secretly stealing pencils from your employer. Treat your spouse right. Spend time with your kids. The sick fascination we get out of tragedy needs to stop. It’s not right and it’s starting to consume us.

I know there are a lot of good people in the news. I would like to ask them to take a step back and look at what they are doing. They are making money off of tragedy. All news is not bad, what I’m talking about is the Dark News. The guilty pleasure news. And we are guilty as the viewers.

## How do we fix it?
Demand change, or simply stop watching their crap. They need views. We are the views.

Also, just try to be a better person, we’re all in this together.
